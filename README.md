# chatgpt-msg-limit-tracker
This is a userscript (such as in Tampermonkey) that will track how many messages you have sent to GPT-4 (ChatGPT) over the last rolling 3 hours and displays it in a box in the upper right of the screen. The GPT-4 version, the more powerful one, has a limit of 25 messages per 3 hours. I'm not exactly sure if that is how they do the math, but it allows me to see how many messages I have left to ask GPT-4. 

A userscript is a piece of javascript that can modify live websites. I use this one with the TamperMonkey extension for Google Chrome.
